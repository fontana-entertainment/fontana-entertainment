This is a personal subsection and place from the founder Markhoss

Now speaking from my view:
I am delighted to finally have learned and been able to create a website for free instead of just creating forums.
By the way a forum for this website is planned and it will be hosted on forumotion most likely within a near possible release date.

On top of that this time I actually have 500MB space which is a crazy amount considering I will only be mostly posting text, images and links.
I'll include a "content feed" as it came to be known of all my activity from all platforms such as youtube, vidlii, instagram, maybe reddit/twitch and my facebook funpage.
(Sorry not including twitter I deleted it many times and not looking forward to come back on that website it was never comfortable in the first place)
