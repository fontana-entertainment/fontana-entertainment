Add /index.html to the end of the website such as fontana-entertainment.github.io/index.html
so it's not missing it which will take you to the homepage

(Because normally using just fontana-entertainment.github.io takes you over to here and not
like you would be normally used to access a website

Also the actual index file is just the homepage however a filetree is planned (no promises)
You can for now view it on github itself if you wish to see the sourcecode!
Link for that is https://github.com/fontana-entertainment/fontana-entertainment.github.io/
